The core social staking feature with multiple phases (it's giving tournament arc):

##### Phase 1: Challenge Creation

   - Define minimum stake amount (1 Aura Point for guilds, 20 for global)
   - Set deadline (future date/time)
   - Submit challenge

2. **Challenge States**:
   - **Active**: Accepting stakes until deadline
   - **Voting**: Proof submitted, community voting (democracy moment)
   - **Completed**: Final results and rewards distribution

##### Phase 2: Staking Period
1. **Stake Placement**:
   - Players browse active challenges
   - Choose "Believe" (will complete) or "Doubt" (won't complete)
   - Set stake amount (minimum enforced)
   - Aura Points locked immediately (commitment issues who?)
   - Cannot stake on own challenges (no cheating bestie)

2. **Stake Tracking**:
   - Real-time pool totals displayed (transparency king)
   - Player's stake history maintained
   - Pool odds calculated dynamically

##### Phase 3: Proof Submission
1. **Creator Responsibility**:
   - 3-hour window after deadline to submit proof (receipts or it didn't happen)
   - Upload photo evidence
   - Add optional description
   - Triggers voting phase

2. **Failure Handling**:
   - No proof = automatic L (skill issue)
   - All stakes refunded if no opposing stakes
   - Challenge marked as completed (failed)

##### Phase 4: Community Voting
1. **Voting Eligibility**:
   - Only players who staked on the challenge can vote
   - Creator cannot vote on own challenge (conflict of interest much?)
   - 2-hour voting window

2. **Voting Process**:
   - Review submitted proof
   - Vote "Legit" (completed) or "Cap" (not completed)
   - One vote per player
   - Majority decision wins (democracy bestie)

##### Phase 5: Reward Distribution
1. **Reward Algorithm**:
   - Winners split the losing pool proportionally (W Players get the bag)
   - Creator gets 10% bonus if on winning side
   - Rewards rounded down to whole Aura Points
   - Automatic Aura Point distribution

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - No stakes on one side = void/refund all
   - Tie votes = challenge fails (L moment)
   - System handles all calculations
