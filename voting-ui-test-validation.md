## Key Features Implemented

1. **Immediate UI Feedback**: Vote buttons now show loading state and disable during submission
2. **Vote Status Display**: Users can see their vote choice and status
3. **Proper State Management**: UI updates immediately and reverts on errors
4. **Real-time Updates**: Other users' votes trigger UI refreshes
5. **Error Prevention**: Duplicate votes are prevented with clear messaging

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before Voting:
- User sees "Vote on Proof" button if they can vote
- Button is enabled and shows vote icon

### During Voting:
- Button shows "Submitting Vote..." and is disabled
- Loading state prevents multiple submissions

### After Successful Vote:
- Button disappears and shows vote status
- "You voted YES/NO on this proof" message appears
- Success alert confirms vote submission

### After Vote Failure:
- Button re-enables for retry
- Specific error message explains the issue
- State reverts to pre-vote condition

### On Page Refresh:
- Vote status persists and displays correctly
- No "Vote on Proof" button if already voted
- Proper vote choice indicator shown
