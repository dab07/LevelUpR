# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical user experience issue where the voting interface doesn't update after a user successfully submits a vote on a challenge proof. Currently, users can vote successfully (the vote is saved to Supabase), but the UI continues to show the "Vote on Proof" button instead of updating to reflect that their vote has been submitted. This creates confusion and may lead users to attempt voting multiple times.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user who has voted on a challenge proof, I want the UI to immediately reflect that my vote has been submitted, so that I know my action was successful and don't attempt to vote again.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully submits a vote on a challenge proof THEN the "Vote on Proof" button SHALL be replaced with a visual indicator showing their vote has been submitted
2. WHEN a user's vote is successfully saved to the database THEN the local challenge state SHALL be updated to reflect the new voting status
3. WHEN the voting UI updates after a successful vote THEN the user SHALL see their specific vote choice (yes/no) displayed
4. WHEN a user has already voted on a challenge THEN the voting button SHALL not be displayed on subsequent page loads

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user interacting with challenges, I want the challenge state to be automatically refreshed after any voting action, so that I always see the most current information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a vote THEN the challenge data SHALL be refreshed from the database
2. WHEN challenge data is refreshed after voting THEN all related UI components SHALL update to reflect the new state
3. WHEN the voting period ends while a user is viewing a challenge THEN the UI SHALL automatically update to show the final results
4. WHEN multiple users are voting on the same challenge THEN each user's UI SHALL reflect real-time updates through proper state management

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user who has voted, I want to see confirmation that my vote was recorded, so that I have confidence in the system's reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully submits a vote THEN a success message SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN the vote submission fails THEN an appropriate error message SHALL be shown
3. WHEN a user views a challenge they have voted on THEN their vote choice SHALL be visually indicated
4. WHEN a user attempts to vote twice on the same challenge THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate voting and show an appropriate message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the voting system, I want proper state management for voting actions, so that the UI remains consistent and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a vote is submitted THEN the local state SHALL be updated before the API call completes to provide immediate feedback
2. WHEN a vote API call fails THEN the local state SHALL be reverted to its previous state
3. WHEN challenge data is fetched THEN the user's voting status SHALL be included in the response
4. WHEN real-time updates occur THEN the voting UI SHALL handle state changes gracefully without causing UI flickers or errors
