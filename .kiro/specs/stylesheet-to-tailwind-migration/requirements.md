# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating all React Native StyleSheet-based styling to Tailwind CSS classes using NativeWind across all TSX files in the LevelUpR application. This migration will improve maintainability, consistency, and developer experience while leveraging the existing NativeWind setup.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all StyleSheet.create() styling converted to Tailwind CSS classes, so that I can maintain consistent styling patterns and improve code readability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a TSX file contains StyleSheet.create() definitions THEN the system SHALL convert all styles to equivalent Tailwind CSS className properties
2. WHEN StyleSheet imports are present THEN the system SHALL remove unused StyleSheet imports after conversion
3. WHEN style props reference StyleSheet objects THEN the system SHALL replace them with appropriate className strings
4. WHEN dynamic styling is used THEN the system SHALL preserve functionality using conditional Tailwind classes or style props where necessary

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the converted Tailwind classes to maintain the exact same visual appearance, so that the user experience remains unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN styles are converted THEN the visual output SHALL remain identical to the original StyleSheet implementation
2. WHEN responsive or conditional styles exist THEN the system SHALL preserve the same behavior using Tailwind responsive prefixes or conditional logic
3. WHEN platform-specific styles are used THEN the system SHALL maintain platform differences using appropriate Tailwind utilities or conditional rendering

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration to follow NativeWind best practices, so that the code is optimized for React Native development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting colors THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind color utilities or arbitrary values with proper hex notation
2. WHEN converting spacing THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind spacing scale or arbitrary values
3. WHEN converting layout properties THEN the system SHALL use appropriate Flexbox and positioning utilities
4. WHEN converting typography THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind text utilities for size, weight, and color

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration to handle complex styling patterns correctly, so that advanced UI components continue to work properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN nested style objects exist THEN the system SHALL flatten them appropriately into className strings
2. WHEN style arrays are used THEN the system SHALL combine multiple className strings or use conditional logic
3. WHEN computed styles are present THEN the system SHALL preserve dynamic behavior using template literals or conditional classes
4. WHEN styles depend on props or state THEN the system SHALL maintain reactivity using appropriate conditional className logic

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration to be applied consistently across all TSX files, so that the entire codebase follows the same styling approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all TSX files in the app/ directory SHALL use Tailwind classes instead of StyleSheet
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all TSX files in the components/ directory SHALL use Tailwind classes instead of StyleSheet
3. WHEN unused StyleSheet imports remain THEN the system SHALL remove them to clean up the codebase
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN no StyleSheet.create() calls SHALL remain in any TSX file
